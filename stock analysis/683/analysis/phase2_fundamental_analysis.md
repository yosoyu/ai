## 2.4 Intrinsic Value Calculation

### Method 1: Net Asset Value (NAV)

For property companies, NAV is the primary valuation method:

```
Book Value: HK$71.84/share
Discount applied: 20-30% (conservative for property)
NAV = HK$71.84 × 0.80 = HK$57.47/share
NAV = HK$71.84 × 0.70 = HK$50.29/share
```

### Method 2: Dividend Discount Model

```
Dividend: HK$1.35/share
Growth: 2% (conservative)
Required Return: 10%

DDM Value = 1.35 × (1.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = HK$17.21/share
```

### Method 3: Earnings Power Value

```
Normalized EPS: HK$2.00 (historical average)
P/E Multiple: 8x (conservative for property)
EPV = HK$2.00 × 8 = HK$16.00/share
```

### Method 4: Sum-of-Parts

| Segment | Estimated Value (HK$/share) |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Investment Properties | 45.00 |
| Development Properties | 15.00 |
| Hotel & Logistics | 5.00 |
| Net Debt | (15.00) |
| **SOTP Value** | **50.00** |

|--------|-------------|--------|
| NAV (80%) | 57.47 | 40% |
| DDM | 17.21 | 15% |
| EPV | 16.00 | 15% |
| SOTP | 50.00 | 30% |
| **Weighted Average** | **45.89** | 100% |

**Current Price:** HK$25.58
