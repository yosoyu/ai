## Investment Decision (Revised)

### Why Rating Downgraded

1. **P/B 2.5x is NOT a bargain** - it's fair value for 11% ROE
2. **Growth is slow** (5%) vs PDD (30%+)
3. **Market share loss** to competitors
4. **No significant margin of safety** at current prices

### When to Buy (Revised)

| Condition | Price | P/B | Action |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Current | HK$150 | 2.5x | HOLD/Small position |
| Better | HK$120-130 | 2.0x | BUY |
| Best | <HK$100 | 1.6x | Strong BUY |

### Why Still Consider Buying

1. P/E 20x reasonable for profitable tech
2. Cloud business undervalued
3. Buybacks providing support
4. Turnaround potential

### When to Avoid

- If you want growth (buy PDD instead)
- If you want deep value (buy Kerry Properties instead)
- If you want income (buy China Mobile instead)

## Conclusion (Corrected)

> **"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."** - Warren Buffett

**Correction:** Alibaba is trading at **fair value**, not deep value.

- P/B 2.5x with 11% ROE = reasonable, not cheap
- P/E 20x = fair for slow-growth tech
- Growth 5% = concerning vs PDD 30%+

**The original thesis of "P/B 0.3x extreme value" was based on incorrect data.**

**REVISED RECOMMENDATION: HOLD/BUY**

- **HOLD** if you already own - fair value, not compelling
- **BUY small position** at HK$130 or below
- **Wait for better entry** if seeking deep value

**Target:** HK$175-180 (+17-20% upside)
**Stop Loss:** HK$100 (-33%)
**Time Horizon:** 3-5 years
**Position Size:** 2-3% of portfolio (reduced from 3-5%)
