## Buffett-Munger Assessment

> **"In evaluating people, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. If you don't have the first, the other two will kill you."** - Warren Buffett

| Quality | Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Integrity | ❌ 1/10 | False endorsement, debtor status, low-ball privatization |
| Intelligence | ⭐ 5/10 | Operations decent, but lacks innovation |
| Energy | ⭐ 3/10 | Product aging, no growth momentum |

**Verdict:** Despite attractive valuation, governance issues make this a **PASS** for Buffett-Munger style investors.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify patent status** via CNIPA or company IR
2. **Check latest annual report** for IP disclosure
3. **Monitor** for any new privatization attempts
4. **Reassess** if price drops below HK$2.50 (40%+ margin of safety)
