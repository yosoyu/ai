## 2.3 Owner Earnings Calculation (Buffett Method)

**Formula:**
```
Owner Earnings = Net Income + D&A - CapEx - Working Capital Changes
```

**Calculation (FY2024 Estimate):**
```
Net Income:           RMB 318.6M
+ Depreciation:       RMB 30-40M (estimated)
- CapEx:              RMB 80-100M (new facility construction)
- Working Capital:    ~RMB 0 (minimal change)
───────────────────────────────
Owner Earnings:       RMB 250-270M
```

**Per Share:**
```
RMB 260M / 739.3M shares = RMB 0.35/share = HK$0.38/share
```

---

## 2.4 Intrinsic Value Calculation

### Method 1: Earnings Power Value (EPV)

```
EPV = Owner Earnings / Required Return

Assuming:
- Owner Earnings: HK$0.38/share
- Required Return: 10% (equity risk premium)

EPV = HK$0.38 / 10% = HK$3.80/share
```

### Method 2: Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

```
Given:
- Current Dividend: HK$0.50/share
- Dividend Yield: 15.7%

If we assume dividend is sustainable:
Fair Value = Dividend / Required Return
Fair Value = HK$0.50 / 10% = HK$5.00/share

But with payout ratio >100%, this is UNSUSTAINABLE!
```

### Method 3: P/E Valuation

```
Current P/E: 7.76x
Fair P/E for stable business: 10-12x

If fair P/E = 10x:
Fair Value = EPS × 10 = HK$0.41 × 10 = HK$4.10/share

If fair P/E = 12x:
Fair Value = HK$0.41 × 12 = HK$4.92/share
```

### Method 4: Book Value + Growth

```
Book Value: HK$1.85/share
ROE: 21.5%

Growth Rate = ROE × Retention Ratio
Retention Ratio = 1 - Payout Ratio = 1 - 1.26 = Negative!

Problem: Company is paying out more than it earns!
```

### Intrinsic Value Summary

| Method | Value (HK$) | Assumptions |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| EPV | 3.80 | 10% required return |
| DDM | 5.00 | Sustainable dividend (NOT valid) |
| P/E (10x) | 4.10 | Fair P/E for stable biz |
| P/E (12x) | 4.92 | Premium P/E |
| **Average** | **4.27** | Excluding DDM |

**Current Price:** HK$3.18
**Margin of Safety:** (4.27 - 3.18) / 4.27 = **25.5%**

   - Only 55% premium to depressed stock price
   - Minority shareholders voted it down
   - Shows misalignment with minority shareholders

2. **"老赖" (Debtor) Status**
   - Founder Jiang Peizhen owed >RMB 51.67M
   - Listed as dishonest debtor (失信被执行人)

3. **Ronaldo False Endorsement (2003-2007)**
   - Tricked Ronaldo into photos used as "endorsement"
   - Shows integrity concerns

### Buffett's Three Qualities Test

> "In evaluating people, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. If you don't have the first, the other two will kill you."

| Quality | Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Integrity** | 1/10 | Failed privatization, debtor status, false endorsement |
| **Intelligence** | 5/10 | Operations decent, but lacks innovation |
| **Energy** | 3/10 | Product aging, no growth momentum |

**Verdict:** Management fails the integrity test - a DISQUALIFYING factor for Buffett-style investors.
