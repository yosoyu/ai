## 4.2 Valuation Analysis

### The Valuation Challenge

**Problem:** With expected losses in 2025, traditional valuation methods don't work well.

| Method | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| P/E | Earnings collapsing to negative |
| DCF | Requires guessing recovery timing |
| SOTP | Assumes businesses maintain value |

### Scenario-Based Valuation

| Scenario | Assumptions | Fair Value (HK$) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bear** | Continued losses, share falls to 40% | 40-50 |
| **Base** | Competition eases 2026, recovery 2027 | 80-100 |
| **Bull** | Price war ends 2025, strong recovery | 120-150 |

### Peer Comparison (When Profitable)

| Company | P/S | P/E |
|---------|-----|-----|
| PDD Holdings | 3.5x | 15x |
| Alibaba | 1.5x | 12x |
| JD.com | 0.4x | 15x |
| **Meituan (current)** | **1.38x** | **N/A** |

**Assessment:** At P/S 1.38x, Meituan is priced closer to JD.com than PDD - market pricing in significant risk.

Meituan is facing **bad economics** due to intense competition:
