1. **Can you tolerate 50%+ volatility?**
   - Stock already down 57%
   - Could go lower before recovering

   - Alibaba has RMB 574B cash
   - JD.com committed to food delivery
   - Douyin has traffic advantage

3. **Are you comfortable with negative earnings?**
   - 2025 expected to be deeply unprofitable
   - Recovery timing unknown

4. **Do you have 3-5 year horizon?**
   - This is not a short-term trade
   - Recovery could take years

## Conclusion

> **"In business, the competition will bite you. If you want to win, you have to bite first."**

Meituan is in a **fight for survival** against deep-pocketed competitors. While the company has strong assets (cash, market position, technology), the competitive dynamics have fundamentally changed.

**Key Unknowns:**
- When will the price war end?
- What will normalized profitability look like?
- Can Meituan defend its market share?

**At current levels (HK$82), the stock is a **SPECULATIVE** position. The risk/reward is unclear, and investors should wait for more clarity before committing significant capital.**

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: HOLD / AVOID**

Better opportunities exist elsewhere (e.g., Kerry Properties 683.HK at similar risk profile but with higher certainty).
