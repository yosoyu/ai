## Conclusion

> **"Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1."** - Warren Buffett

CoreWeave violates both rules:

- **Rule 1:** Company is losing $825M/year
- **Rule 2:** Bankruptcy risk is real (485% D/E, 3-4 month cash runway)

While the AI infrastructure thesis is compelling, the **financial structure is dangerous**. The company is:
- Burning cash faster than it can generate
- Drowning in debt
- Dependent on a single customer and single supplier
- Without a clear path to profitability

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: AVOID**

For AI exposure, consider established, profitable companies with cleaner balance sheets. For deep value, Kerry Properties (683.HK) offers better risk/reward.
