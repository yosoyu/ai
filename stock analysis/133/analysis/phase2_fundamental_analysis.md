## 2.4 Intrinsic Value Calculation

### Method 1: Net Asset Value (NAV)
For investment funds, NAV is the primary valuation method:

```
Reported NAV: US$4.445/share (HK$34.48)
Conservative Haircut (20%): US$3.56/share (HK$27.62)
Conservative Haircut (30%): US$3.11/share (HK$24.14)
```

### Method 2: Sum-of-Parts (SOTP)
| Segment | Estimated Value (US$/share) |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Listed Holdings (73% of NAV) | 3.24 |
| Unlisted Holdings (27% at 50%) | 0.60 |
| Cash & Other | 0.30 |
| Less: Future Fee Drag (5yr) | (0.40) |
| **SOTP Value** | **3.74** |

*In HK$: ~HK$29.00*

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model
```
Annual Dividend: ~HK$0.80-1.00
Dividend Yield at Current Price: 4-8%
Growth: 0-2% (limited growth due to fee drag)
Required Return: 10%

DDM Value = 0.90 × 1.01 / (0.10 - 0.01) = HK$10.10
```
*Note: DDM undervalues fund with significant assets*
