### 🔴 Critical Risk: Antitrust Investigation

|--------|---------|
| Investigator | State Administration for Market Regulation |
| Allegation | Monopoly practices in online travel |
| Impact | Valuation multiple compressed |
| Potential Fine | Unknown, may not affect adjusted profit |
| Timeline | Ongoing, no resolution date |

**This is the KEY reason for HOLD recommendation**

### ⚠️ Data Discrepancies Found

| Metric | Analysis | Verified | Impact |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| ROE | 20.2% | 3.78% (5yr avg) | Significant overstatement |
| P/E | 14.3x | 16.9-20.4x | Less cheap than thought |
| P/B | 1.44x | 1.98-2.24x | Higher valuation |

**Note:** The original ROE of 20.2% may have been a single-year figure, while 3.78% is the 5-year average. This significantly changes the quality assessment.

## Conclusion

> **"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."** - Warren Buffett

Trip.com is a **quality business**, but verified data shows it's less attractive than originally analyzed:

**Strengths:**
- 31-52% profit margin (excellent)
- Market leader in growing industry
- Strong gross margins (~81%)

**Concerns:**
- Antitrust investigation ongoing
- ROE lower than analyzed (3.78% avg vs 20.2%)
- P/E higher than analyzed (17-20x vs 14x)
- Consumer spending weakness

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: HOLD**

Wait for antitrust investigation resolution before adding position. The verified valuation is less attractive than originally analyzed.

**If buying:** Wait for HK$380-400 or investigation resolution
**If holding:** Maintain, set stop at HK$350
**Time Horizon:** 2-3 years
**Position Size:** 2-3% maximum
